# finding-the-dominant-color
The aim of the project is to divide the pixels in an image selected from the user's computer into clusters in a determined number, assign a color that is the average of the colors there, to each cluster, and then find the cluster with the highest pixels, that is, the dominant color, by finding how many pixels there are in each cluster.
